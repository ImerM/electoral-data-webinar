# Electoral Data Analysis Webinar

This repo contains scripts written during a webinar organized by [Balkansmedia](http://balkansmedia.org/) focused on collecting and analysing data from electoral commisions based in the Western Balkans. Written in python it is ment to be a simple demonstration of how to communicate with an API and is thus fairly straightforwards. The API in question is a public one from the [Central Electoral Commision of North Macedonia](https://rezultati.sec.mk/en-US/1/r).

mkd_results_per_munic.py - collects data on a per-municipality level
mkd_results_per_polling.py - collects data on a per-polling station level

Input csv files included, if anyone wants to do further analysis of this data.
